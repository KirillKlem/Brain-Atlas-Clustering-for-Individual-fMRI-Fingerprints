# Brain-Atlas-Clustering-for-Individual-fMRI-Fingerprints
This project clusters fMRI data based on brain connectivity patterns across two brain atlases (200 and 246 components). Using spectral clustering, feature extraction, and KNN imputation, the algorithm groups brain scans into clusters, ensuring balanced distribution and handling real-world noise and missing data.
